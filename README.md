Ad Astra! (translation: "To the Stars!") is a space mod for Fabric and Forge with a focus on technology, travel and
exploration. We've got
everything you need to become an astronaut: rockets, space suits, space stations and machines. Why not take a stroll on
the Moon? Build a self-sustaining bunker on Mars? Go mining on Venus? The entire Solar System, better yet, Milky Way, is
at your disposal!

Consider downloading REI, JEI, or EMI for recipe viewing. Ad Astra! also has an in-game Patchouli guidebook called the "Astrodux," which will guide you through progression.
